## Propensity Score Matching with Nearest Neighbour Paper 

A paper that examines the unidirectional casual effect of Income on Job Satisfaction amongst working class Americans. Using the 2020 Public Stack Overflow Survey data, the technique of Propensity Score Matching is implemented with the Nearest Neighbor approach which creates treatment and control groups to find the strength of the association between Income and Job Satisfaction by calculating the ATT. The paper proves a weak causal relationship between Income and Job Satisfaction and ends with possible caveats in the approach used.
